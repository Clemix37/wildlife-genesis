# Wildlife Genesis

A TypeScript app simulating an ecosystem ðŸ¥€ðŸª´

## Concept

Trying to reproduce a little ecosystem in TypeScript.  
Animals can eat plants, can reproduce, but also have a probability of dying.  
If an animal has not eaten in 5 days, he dies.  
Plants can grow, reproduce and might die.  
Some plants ar not eatable by animals, such as trees.

Plants have a small percentage of becoming venenous. (TODO)

Animals ðŸ¦„ start by having a chance of ~0.2% to be killed, ~60% to eat a life, ~39% to reproduce itself.

Plants ðŸª´ start by having a chance of ~4% to be killed, ~74% to grow, ~22% to reproduce itself.
